# Version History

### v0.2d
* Added Dockerfile and yml files for influxdb and grafana.
* Added grafana and influxdb services to ingress.
* Moved nginx.yml to ft_services/srcs.
* Changed font and background color of index.html (used in nginx pods).

### v0.16d
* Started working on influxdb-telegraf-grafana stack. Nothing major has been added, only loose instructions in "/srcs/influxdb/readme" used to get the stack working in a single docker container. Future work will be towards implementing this within a kubernetes environment.

### v0.15
* Moved "del" script to ft_server root folder.
* Deleted "mk" and "re" scripts.
* Created "setup.sh", which for now uses "del" scripts (to clean up running cluster) and passes minikube IP to both the html index page (in nginx) and creates an environment variable IP within every nginx pod (with the same minikube IP value).
* Restructured: moved yml files to ft_server/srcs; Dockerfile to ft_server/srcs/nginx/.
* Moved "readme" file to root folder (this file contains interesting commands which are useful during development).

### v0.11d
* Edited Dockerfile, now does not rely on "start" script.
* Modified "re", "mk", "del" scripts to stop any pods, deployments, services and ingresses before proceeding.
* Added index.html (forgot to add on v0.1d).
* Modified "ingress.yml".
* Modified "nginx.conf"

### v0.1d
(Version has a lot of forgotten items, avoid this version).
* Working nginx container launch with kubernetes (both http and https).
* Added html index page which will hold all the necessary links (correction v0.011d: forgot to add to this commit).
* Deleted "start.sh" and incorportated into Dockerfile.
* Added "re", "mk" and "del" scripts temporarily to speed up testing.
